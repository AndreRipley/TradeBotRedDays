# Trading Bot - Improved Anomaly Detection Strategy

An automated trading bot that uses statistical anomaly detection to identify and capitalize on oversold and overbought conditions in the stock market. The bot implements a sophisticated strategy with risk management features including stop-losses, trailing stops, and dynamic position sizing.

## Strategy Overview

The bot uses an **Improved Anomaly Buy+Sell Strategy** that:

- **Detects statistical anomalies** in real-time using multiple technical indicators
- **Trades on oversold conditions** (buy signals) and **overbought conditions** (sell signals)
- **Manages risk** with stop-losses and trailing stops
- **Adapts position sizing** based on stock performance
- **Monitors continuously** during market hours for trading opportunities

## Features

- ✅ **Real-time anomaly detection** using Z-scores, RSI, price action, and volume analysis
- ✅ **Continuous monitoring** - checks all stocks every minute during market hours
- ✅ **Risk management** - 5% stop-loss and 5% trailing stop on all positions
- ✅ **Dynamic position sizing** - increases size for winners, decreases for losers
- ✅ **Position monitoring** - checks open positions every minute for stop-loss triggers
- ✅ **30 diversified stocks** by default (across 7 sectors)
- ✅ **Paper trading support** via Alpaca API
- ✅ **Cloud deployment ready** - runs 24/7 on Google Cloud Run
- ✅ **Comprehensive logging** and error handling

## Strategy Details

### Anomaly Detection

The bot detects anomalies using multiple indicators:

**Buy Signals (Oversold Conditions):**
- Z-score < -2.0 (price 2+ standard deviations below 20-day mean)
- Price drop > 3% in a day
- Gap down > 2% from previous close
- RSI < 30 (oversold)

**Sell Signals (Overbought Conditions):**
- Z-score > 2.0 (price 2+ standard deviations above mean)
- Price rise > 3% in a day
- Gap up > 2% from previous close
- RSI > 70 (overbought)

### Trading Logic

1. **Severity Threshold**: Only trades anomalies with severity ≥ 1.0
2. **Position Limits**: Won't buy if already holding that stock
3. **Account Balance**: Checks buying power before each trade
4. **Risk Management**: Stop-losses and trailing stops protect capital

### Risk Management

- **Stop-Loss**: 5% below entry price (fixed protection)
- **Trailing Stop**: 5% below highest price reached (locks in gains)
- **Position Monitoring**: Checks every minute during market hours
- **Dynamic Sizing**: Adjusts position size based on win rate:
  - Win rate ≥ 60%: +20% position size
  - Win rate 50-60%: Normal size
  - Win rate 40-50%: -20% position size
  - Win rate < 40%: -40% position size

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Trading API account (Alpaca recommended for paper trading)
- Stock data API (Alpha Vantage - optional, Yahoo Finance fallback available)

bash deploy_fix_permissions.sh
```

See `GCP_DEPLOYMENT.md` and `CLOUD_RUN_ENV_VARS.md` for detailed instructions.

## How It Works

### Trading Schedule

- **Signal Detection**: Every 1 minute during market hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET, weekdays)
- **Position Monitoring**: Every 1 minute during market hours
- **Stocks Monitored**: 30 stocks by default (configurable)

### Trading Process

1. **Every Minute During Market Hours:**
   - Fetches recent price data for all monitored stocks
   - Calculates technical indicators (Z-score, RSI, volume, gaps)
   - Detects anomalies and calculates severity scores
   - Executes trades if severity ≥ 1.0 and conditions are met
   - Checks existing positions for stop-loss/trailing stop triggers

2. **Buy Signal Execution:**
   - Checks account balance and buying power
   - Calculates dynamic position size based on stock performance
   - Executes buy order via Alpaca API
   - Sets stop-loss and trailing stop prices
   - Tracks position for monitoring

3. **Sell Signal Execution:**
   - Detects overbought conditions (severity ≥ 3.0)
   - Executes sell order
   - Calculates profit/loss
   - Updates performance tracking

4. **Position Monitoring:**
   - Checks current price every minute
   - Updates trailing stop if price increases
   - Executes sell if stop-loss or trailing stop triggered
   - Protects capital from rapid declines

## Default Stock List

The bot monitors 30 diversified stocks by default:

**Technology (11):** AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, NVDA, META, TSLA, ADBE, CSCO, NFLX, ACN  
**Finance (3):** V, JPM, MA  
**Healthcare (7):** UNH, JNJ, LLY, MRK, ABBV, ABT, TMO

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- **STOCKS**: Comma-separated stock symbols (no spaces)
- **POSITION_SIZE**: Dollar amount per stock (default: 1000.0)
- **TIMEZONE**: Market timezone (default: America/New_York)
- **LOG_LEVEL**: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR (default: INFO)

### Strategy Parameters

Configured in `scheduler.py`:
- `min_severity`: 1.0 (minimum anomaly severity to trade)
- `stop_loss_pct`: 0.05 (5% stop-loss)
- `trailing_stop_pct`: 0.05 (5% trailing stop)

## API Setup

### Alpaca (Required for Trading)

1. Sign up at https://alpaca.markets/
2. Get your API keys from the dashboard
3. Use paper trading URL: `https://paper-api.alpaca.markets`
4. Add keys to `.env` or Cloud Run environment variables

### Alpha Vantage (Optional)

1. Get free API key from https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key
2. Add to `.env` as `ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY`
3. If not provided, bot uses Yahoo Finance (free, no API key needed)

## Monitoring & Logs

### View Logs

**Local:**
```bash
tail -f trading_bot.log
```

**Cloud Run:**
```bash
bash view_logs.sh          # View recent logs
bash stream_logs.sh         # Stream logs (polling)
bash check_cloud_bot.sh     # Check bot status
```

**Browser:**
- Go to Google Cloud Console → Cloud Run → trading-bot → LOGS tab

### What to Look For

- `🟢 BUY SIGNAL detected` - Anomaly detected, trade executed
- `🔴 SELL SIGNAL detected` - Overbought condition or stop-loss triggered
- `🔍 Monitoring X positions` - Position monitoring active
- `💰 Account Balance` - Buying power check before trades
- `⚠️ INSUFFICIENT BUYING POWER` - Need to add funds

## Safety Features

- **Paper trading mode** by default (Alpaca)
- **Account balance checking** before trades
- **Stop-losses** limit downside risk
- **Trailing stops** protect profits
- **Dynamic position sizing** reduces risk on losing stocks
- **Comprehensive error handling** and logging
- **Simulated orders** if no API credentials provided

## Expected Performance

- **Trade Frequency**: 0-5 trades per day (strategy is selective)
- **Win Rate**: Varies by market conditions
- **Risk Management**: Stop-losses limit losses to 5% per position
- **Capital Utilization**: Monitors 30 stocks, trades when opportunities arise

The strategy prioritizes **quality over quantity** - waiting for significant anomalies rather than trading constantly.

## Troubleshooting

### Low Trade Frequency

This is **normal** - the strategy is selective:
- Only trades anomalies with severity ≥ 1.0
- Requires specific conditions (oversold/overbought)
- Won't buy if already holding a stock
- See `TROUBLESHOOTING_LOW_TRADES.md` for details

### Insufficient Buying Power

- Add funds to Alpaca paper account: https://app.alpaca.markets/paper/dashboard/account
- Or reduce `POSITION_SIZE` in environment variables
- See `FIX_BUYING_POWER.md` for solutions

### Other Issues

- **"command not found: python"**: Use `python3` on macOS
- **No trades executing**: Check logs, verify API keys, ensure market hours
- **API errors**: Verify credentials and rate limits
- **Price data issues**: Check internet connection

## Important Notes

⚠️ **DISCLAIMER**: This bot is for educational purposes. Always test with paper trading first. Trading involves risk of financial loss. Use at your own risk.

- **Cloud Deployment**: Bot runs 24/7 on Cloud Run (no computer needed)
- **Market Hours**: Only trades 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET on weekdays
